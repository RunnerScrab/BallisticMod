# BallisticMod
A 7DTD modlet which attempts to make firearm ballistics/handling more realistic. It ALSO stops the crosshairs
from showing up while you're aiming down iron sights or through a scope on weapons which have them.

INSTALLATION:
1. Place the BallisticMod folder in your 7 Days To Die mod folder (e.g: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\")
2. Start the game

The numbers I've used in my mod are unscientific (I haven't gone out to shoot through a chronograph or measured group sizes or anything), but:

* Long-barreled shotguns are now more accurate and have greater effective reach. 
* Handguns now have realistic range and accuracy, though remain extremely effective within 30 yards
* Rifles have much better range and accuracy than anything else, more so than before (though are probably first limited by the game's max view distance)
