# BallisticMod
## Overview
A 7DTD modlet which attempts to make firearm ballistics/handling more realistic. It ALSO stops the crosshairs
from showing up while you're aiming down iron sights or through a scope on weapons which have them.

* Long-barreled shotguns are now more accurate and have greater effective reach.
* Blunderbusses behave similarly how they did before and still have limited range and a very wide spread
* Handguns now have realistic range and accuracy and remain extremely effective
* Rifles have much better range and accuracy than anything else, more so than before (though are probably first limited by the game's max view distance)

The numbers I've used in my mod are calculated loosely based on what I could find in the way of the real world MOAs, shot spread, and effective ranges, with handling values (when shooting "from the hip") an arbitrary compromise roughly correlating to weapon length and sight radius.

Shotguns are peculiar in 7DTD because the game makes no distinction between shot spread and accuracy. Trying to reduce accuracy while "shooting from the hip" would be the same as increasing shot spread: while this would decrease accuracy at long range, it would also have the effect of making a shot hit everything in close range regardless of where it was pointed - this has totally no bearing on reality. Therefore, I've made shotguns always fire with maximum accuracy - their iron sights only serve as a zoom.

## INSTALLATION:
1. Place the BallisticMod folder in your 7 Days To Die mod folder (e.g: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\")
