# BallisticMod
## Overview
A 7DTD modlet which attempts to make firearm ballistics/handling more realistic. Developed for A19.

* Crosshairs will not appear while aiming a weapon with sights or optics
* Shotguns are now more accurate and have greater effective reach.
* Blunderbusses behave similarly how they did before and still have limited range and a very wide spread
* Handguns now have realistic range and accuracy and remain extremely effective
* Rifles have much better range and accuracy than anything else, more so than before (though are probably first limited by the game's max view distance)
* Handguns benefit least from being aimed, shotguns slightly more, and rifles the most

The numbers I've used in my mod are calculated loosely based on what I could find in the way of the real world MOAs, shot spread, and effective ranges. Handling values (when shooting "from the hip") are an arbitrary, eyeballed compromise roughly correlating to weapon lengths and sight radii.

Shotguns are peculiar in games like 7DTD because no distinction is made between shot spread and accuracy. Increasing spread decreases accuracy at long ranges, but greatly increases hit probability at close range regardless of where the weapon is pointed - a situation with no bearing in reality (targets should only be easier to hit at closer ranges because they are effectively larger). As a compromise between accuracy and power when shooting from the hip, I've given shotguns similar handling characteristics to handguns. Not entirely realistic, but better than the alternatives.

## INSTALLATION:
1. Create a folder named "Mods" in your 7DTD directory if it doesn't not already exist (e.g: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\")
1. Place the BallisticMod folder in your 7 Days To Die mods folder
2. Start the game

## UNINSTALLATION
1. Remove/delete BallisticMod folder from the 7DTD Mods directory
